# Introduction to Git and GitHub for Python Developers

### What Is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).

### Version Control
A version control system (VCS) is a set of tools that track the history of a set of files. This means that you can tell your VCS (Git, in our case) to save the state of your files at any point. Then, you may continue to edit the files and store that state as well. Saving the state is similar to creating a backup copy of your working directory. When using Git, we refer to this saving of state as making a commit.

### Distributed Version Control

OK, so that’s a version control system. What’s the distributed part? It’s probably easiest to answer that question by starting with a little history. Early version control systems worked by storing all of those commits locally on your hard drive. This collection of commits is called a repository. This solved the “I need to get back to where I was” problem but didn’t scale well for a team working on the same codebase.
